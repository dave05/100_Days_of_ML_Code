Day 1: Jan 2, 2019

Lesson: Introduction to Pytorch

Takeaways: Installing and Experimenting PyTorch and apply:
              -implementing single and multi layer NN
              -implementing softmax and different activation function
              -how to use nn module to create Neural Network models
Thoughts: PyTorch is very Pythonic( Very similar with Numpy and Pandas) and has a lot of very useful packages with datasets and models.
